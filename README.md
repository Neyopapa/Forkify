# Forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.

# Introduction

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.

# Technologies Used:

HTML & CSS The layout was carefully designed using CSS3 BEM naming convention. CSS-Grid was used to comply with the newest standards of development.

JavaScript No frameworks were used in the development of this application. All functionality was built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript so feel free to dive into the code.

Webpack Webpack was used as the module bundler to incorporate Axios for fetching as well as BABEL for compiling the next-gen JavaScript.
